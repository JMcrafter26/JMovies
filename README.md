# JMovies - Movie Library

![assets/image/logo/logo.png](assets/image/logo/logo.png)

This repo is for my school project. It is a movie library that allows users to search for movies, view movie details, and add movies to their watchlist.

It's mainly inspired by the [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) and [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) websites.
